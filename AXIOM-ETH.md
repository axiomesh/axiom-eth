# Axiom-Eth: Customized Ethereum Development

## Overview
Axiom-Eth is a customized version of the Ethereum blockchain, tailored for specific use cases and enhancements. This project is forked from the official Go Ethereum (Geth) repository, specifically basing our customizations on the `v1.12.0` tag, which marks a stable release of the Ethereum protocol implemented in Go.

## Customization
Our development efforts focus on integrating additional features and optimizations that address the unique needs of our project. These customizations aim to enhance performance, security, and usability, ensuring that Axiom-Eth stands out as a specialized solution within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Goals
- To provide a stable and efficient Ethereum-based platform that meets the specific requirements of our users.
- To contribute back to the Ethereum community by sharing insights and improvements that may benefit others.

## Getting Started
To get started with Axiom-Eth, clone the repository and check out the `dev` branch, where all our custom developments are actively taking place:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomesh/axiom-eth.git
cd axiom-eth
git checkout dev
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. If you're interested in helping us improve Axiom-Eth, please take a look at our contribution guidelines and open a pull request with your suggestions.
